Required, among other things:

* `jq`
* `python3`
* `bzip2`
* `xz`
* `zsh`
* `zstd`

This does not handle:

* Reddit data before December 2005
* Reddit data after December 2019

2020 data is potentially TODO, but only three and a half months of comment data are provided, and only in daily batches, and it's GZIP'd, so it's not super motivating.
